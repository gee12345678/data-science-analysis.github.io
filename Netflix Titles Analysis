# Netflix Titles Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the Netflix dataset from Kaggle to uncover insights about content trends, viewer preferences, and production patterns. Using Python and data visualization tools, I explore various aspects of Netflix's content library to provide actionable insights for content strategy.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is the "Netflix Movies and TV Shows" dataset from Kaggle, which contains information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix as of 2021, including:
- Title, director, and cast information
- Release year, country, and rating
- Duration, genre, and description

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.8+
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical operations
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
- Jupyter Notebooks for analysis documentation

## Key Findings
1. Content growth trends over time
2. Most common genres and their popularity trends
3. Geographic distribution of content production
4. Seasonal patterns in content releases
5. Duration analysis for movies and TV shows
