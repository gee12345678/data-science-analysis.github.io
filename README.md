- Visualize correlations between likes, views, and comments
- Determine the impact of tags, titles, and categories on video performance

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries Used:
- **Python** (for data processing and visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for code + commentary)
- **Pandas** (for data cleaning and manipulation)
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** (for visualizations)
- **Plotly** (for interactive charts)
- **NumPy** (for numeric calculations)

### üìà Sample Visualizations:
- Correlation heatmaps
- Bar plots for monthly video uploads
- Pie charts for category distribution
- Distribution of likes and comments

### üìÅ Files:
